The tears streaming down the side of my face kept finding their way to be stuck between my ears and earbuds. The wet sensation added to the blood-pounding pulsing created the weirdest warm and moist combination. Only if I can roar out this encroachment of my body right now. But I couldn’t – I could barely breathe! There is nothing I could do! I am nothing but a floating ghost watching this terror going down on my body once more.</p><p><em>I get tired, and I get sick, and then I lose the strength to leave</em></p><p>This must be how it feels like to drown – I thought to myself. The air feels like seawater from the deepest abyssal ocean. It’s slowly freezing every single inch of my body and stuffing up every single space it can find its way into. I’m like a build-a-bear doll over-bloated with cotton and about to explode. If this is a battle between me and the sea, this dead weight is about to be the prime culprit of drowning me and washing me upon the shore like a dead fish. Even my vision began fading and blurring on the edges as if I were looking through a fish-eye lens. My eyes looked like two red balloons, heavy and swollen with tears. Why does it matter, though? It’s not like the white ceiling needed any special attention. With these two balloons flying sky-high for hours, I lost the energy to keep them open. </p><p>What am I even crying for?</p><p><em>I can’t handle change</em></p><p><em>I can’t handle change</em></p><p>The music took a turn and paused for a moment. I could hear my heartbeat in my throat. </p><p>Lub-dub.</p><p>Lub-DUB.</p><p>LUB-DUB.</p><p>It’s getting faster. It’s getting louder. It’s about to jump out of my chest. It’s about to be drained by the preying ocean. </p><p><em>Nothing I do is ever good</em></p><p><em>Nothing I do is ever good enough</em></p><p><em>Nothing I do is ever good</em></p><p><em>Nothing I do is ever good</em></p><p><em>Nothing I do is ever good enough</em></p><p><em>Nothing I do is ever good</em></p><p>​       I know this is all my fault. I don’t know what for, but I deserve nothing less than to witness this torture of my own. </p><p><em>Leave me alone</em></p><p><em>Leave me alone</em></p><p><em>Leave me alone</em></p><p><em>Leave me alone</em></p><p>The waves slowly carry my body to shore; I can feel it getting lighter and lighter, all the way until I lose consciousness. </p><p><em>I can’t help but repeat myself</em></p><p><em>I know it’s not your fault</em></p><center>...</center><p><em>“Still lately, I begin to shake</em></p><p><em>For no reason at all,</em></p><p><em>For no reason at all,</em></p><p><em>For no reason at all,</em></p><p><em>For no reason at all,</em></p><p><em>For no reason at all.”</em></p>]]></content>
